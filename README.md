> A library of React hooks and HOCs written in Typescript to use Tensorflow models in your application! ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ 

## Installation

```sh
yarn add react-tensorflow
```

```sh
npm i react-tensorflow -S
```

### Peer dependencies

- [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) >=16.8.0
- [@tensorflow/tfjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs) >=2.0.0

## Basic usage

```js
import { useModel } from 'react-tensorflow'

const MyModelComponent = () => {
  const model = useModel(`${PATH_TO_MODEL}`)

  // ...do something with the model

  return null
}
```

## API

### useModel

```js
useModel({model?: any, modelUrl?: string, layers?: boolean}): GraphModel | LayersModel | null
```

If `model` or `modelUrl` is omitted useModel will look to find the ModelProvider as it's context for returning the model. When loading a model with this hook, the `layers` boolean is passed if your TF model should be loaded with the function `tf.loadLayersModel` otherwise it is assumed the model should be loaded with `tf.loadGraphModel`.

### ModelProvider

```js
<ModelProvider url={string} layers={boolean}>
  <App />
</ModelProvider>
```

Wraps the children in a React Provider to be consumed by Context's in either the `useModel` hook or `withModel` HOC. The props passed to this provider are the same as the documented props for `useModel`.

### withModel

```js
withModel(Component: React.ComponentType): JSX.Element
```

Wraps the provided component in a React Context, passing the model give to the provider as a prop.

### useWebcam

```js
useWebcam (options?: {
    width?: number
    height?: number
    facingMode?: string
  }): [React.MutableRefObject, tf.Tensor | null]
```

Provides a ref to be used on a video element, the hook then returns a tensor with shape `[1, width, height, 3]` where the width and height are either dictated by the element's width & height or the provided argument documented above. The options argument while documented above can infact take all the properties of the [MediaStreamConstraints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamConstraints).

### usePrediction

```js
usePrediction (options?: {
  predictConfig?: {},
  useExecute?: boolean = false,
  outputName?: string,
  predictionFunction?: string,
  ...useModelProps,
}): [React.MutableRefObject<tf.Tensor>, tf.Tensor | tf.Tensor[] | tf.NamedTensorMap | null]
```

Provides a ref to the data you want to use to create a prediction. The data must be in the form of a tensor. It then returns a new tensor as the prediction using either the model set with the `ModelProvider` component or by passing a modelUrl as an argument as it uses `useModel` under the hood. You can then perform different actions such as normalizing the data for to classify the original input. By default `usePrediction` uses `.predict`, if you want to force the use of `.execute` set `useExecute: true` and if you want to use a custom predict function, pass it's name via the `predictionFunction` key. If you're using a LayersModel you must set `outputName`. At this time using a `@tensorflow-models` model is not supported with `usePrediction`.
